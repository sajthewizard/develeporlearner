               Most of the days I have work. As of now I am learning web developing my schedule got a bit tough. When I want to laugh like that, there are a couple of friends I always call. Within minutes, we can hardly speak because the tears are rolling, noses are running, and our breath is coming in short pants!

               In my own blog, I write frequently about how to find sustained happiness. This kind of happiness involves a shift in perspective and sometimes a lifestyle overhaul. Laughter, and the cleansing joy that it provides, should be a daily ritual that contributes to sustained happiness. Like a spoon full of sugar, it helps the medicine go down.
